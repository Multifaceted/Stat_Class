PCA(num of factors) -> Behavioral Data(num of clusters) -> Cluster -> Personal Data(bivariate qualitative)
k-means 1) business needs 2) input dimensinality
cluster too small -- reduce k
cluster too big -- increase k
eliminate outliers and repeat
CP cluster ANOVA
Same case choose smaller k
hierarchical computational expensive/nonrandom/dendogram branches the highest
combine two methods
